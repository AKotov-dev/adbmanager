11=+ RPM dependencies: added `qtbase6-common`, `qt6pas`
12=+ DEB dependencies: added `libqt6core6`, `libqt6gui6`, `libqt6widgets6`, `libqt6network6`, `libqt6printsupport6`, `libqt6pas6`
13=+ Added a RAM device indicator: Total / Available (%)
14=+ Improved overall multithreading and responsiveness
15=+ Improved switching of devices in offline status (TCP/IP)
16=+ Improved the procedure for stopping package installations
17=+ Mageia-9 and Ubuntu >= 25.04 packages
18=
19=**Note:** Build for maintainers: `lazbuild --build-mode=Release adbmanager.lpi` and `lazbuild --build-mode=Qt6 adbmanager.lpi`. Build in Lazarus in two modes: `Release` and `Qt6`. For Mageia 9, a backport from Mageia 10 has been published here: lib64qt6pas6 and lib64qt6pas-devel.

23=+ Dependencies RPM/DEB: replace `imagemagick` with `graphicsmagick`
24=+ Improved application list output stream
25=+ Improved SDCard manager for different DPI (text alignment)
26=+ Improved package search in the application manager (multiselect)
27=+ Double-clicking in the SDCard manager opens files using xdg-open

32=+ Added RPM/DEB dependency: `imagemagick`

44=
45=v3.4
46=+ Fine-tuning for Android TV Box
47=+ Mageia-9 and Debian packages + AppImage
48=
49=**Note:** Chinese Android TV Boxes often have stripped-down launchers installed, in which it is impossible to adjust the volume with the remote control, automatic updates and synchronization of Google accounts are not disabled, and there is even no control over system sounds (remote control clicks, etc.). In addition, excessive interface animation with a small amount of memory reduces the overall performance of the device. Now all this can be configured via ADB.
50=
51=v3.3
52=+ Added dependency `p7zip`
53=+ Cancel bulk package installation with `Esc`
54=+ Request to cancel package installation on exit
