6=+ Mageia-9 and Ubuntu >= 25.04 packages
7=
8=v3.8
9=+ Added `ADBManager-Qt` version (Qt6 widgets)
10=+ RPM dependencies: added `qtbase6-common`, `qt6pas`
11=+ DEB dependencies: added `libqt6core6`, `libqt6gui6`, `libqt6widgets6`, `libqt6network6`, `libqt6printsupport6`, `libqt6pas6`
12=+ Added a RAM device indicator: Total / Available (%)
13=+ Improved overall multithreading and responsiveness
14=+ Improved switching of devices in offline status (TCP/IP)
15=+ Improved the procedure for stopping package installations
16=+ Mageia-9 and Ubuntu >= 25.04 packages
17=
18=**Note:** Build for maintainers: `lazbuild --build-mode=Release adbmanager.lpi` and `lazbuild --build-mode=Qt6 adbmanager.lpi`. Build in Lazarus in two modes: `Release` and `Qt6`. For Mageia 9, a backport from Mageia 10 has been published here: lib64qt6pas6 and lib64qt6pas-devel.
19=
20=v3.7
21=+ Dependencies RPM/DEB: added `xdg-utils`
22=+ Dependencies RPM/DEB: replace `imagemagick` with `graphicsmagick`
23=+ Improved application list output stream
24=+ Improved SDCard manager for different DPI (text alignment)
25=+ Improved package search in the application manager (multiselect)
26=+ Double-clicking in the SDCard manager opens files using xdg-open
27=+ Mageia-9 and Debian packages
28=
29=v3.6
30=+ Icons in the app list if `IconExtractor.akp` is installed on the smartphone
31=+ Added RPM/DEB dependency: `imagemagick`
32=+ Mageia-9 and Debian packages

43=
44=v3.4
45=+ Fine-tuning for Android TV Box
46=+ Mageia-9 and Debian packages + AppImage
47=
48=**Note:** Chinese Android TV Boxes often have stripped-down launchers installed, in which it is impossible to adjust the volume with the remote control, automatic updates and synchronization of Google accounts are not disabled, and there is even no control over system sounds (remote control clicks, etc.). In addition, excessive interface animation with a small amount of memory reduces the overall performance of the device. Now all this can be configured via ADB.
49=
50=v3.3
51=+ Added dependency `p7zip`
52=+ Cancel bulk package installation with `Esc`
53=+ Request to cancel package installation on exit
